Concrete Action is a collective comprised of architects, journalists and researchers which aims towards a more ethical and transparent practices of architecture and planning. 

The concreteaction.net site has been operational since 2015 as a space is for those working in building design, planning and construction to anonymously provide advance information on proposed developments, to disseminate planning and development knowledge to communities and activists, and to link professionals who are willing to provide educational and design services for those negatively affected by property development.

Assisting community groups in understanding the planning process led to the need for a better understanding of the obstacles to forming alternative models for regeneration. 

Since September 2017 Concrete Action is resident one day a week at MayDayRooms, an archival space in London, researching the history of collective practice in architecture with a focus on unionisation.
