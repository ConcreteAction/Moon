Concrete Action is a collective comprised of architects, journalists and researchers working towards ethical and transparent practices of architecture and planning. 

The concreteaction.net site has been operational since 2015 as a space for those working in building design, planning and construction to anonymously provide advance information on proposed developments, to disseminate planning and development knowledge to communities and activists, and to link professionals who are willing to provide educational and design services for those negatively affected by property development.
