<b> Why leaks? </b>

What we are doing is driven by a desire to create a level playing field in the realm of redevelopment. The planning process is widely touted as a public and accountable process - we do not believe that this is the case, therefore it is up to us to take matters into our own hands and try to force the process to become more public, more transparent and for the benefit of people living in affected areas rather than absent property owners, developers and investor conglomerates.

There is gradual progress in legal terms, however there are many communities who need information about what is happening to their area now, faster than an overhaul of the planning process or a freedom of information request.

Whistleblowing has a proud history of helping to create change! By artificially speeding up the availability of information it creates pressure on the existing system - we are not against development in principle, but we want development for and with all residents of the city.

If you have access to information which you believe is being wrongfully withheld from the public, we are here for you.

<b> How to send us information <b/>
    
Everything you do online leaves a trace, but there are things you can do to minimise these. If you would like to send us a document or documentation to publish it is your responsibility to decide what level of anonymity and security you need. We will do our best to support anyone who sends us information but we are not able to take responsibility for the consequences if you are put at risk in the process. If you have information the public ought to know, please get in touch using signal messenger on the number below. You can download signal from the appropriate app store on your phone.

Do not send us information which has been obtained by criminal means, personal information about you or anyone else, or any other information which it would not be in the public interest to publish.
