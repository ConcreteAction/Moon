We are researching the history of attempts to collectively organise around Architectural Practice as a research residency at [May Day Rooms](http://maydayrooms.org/) in London. We aim to learn from past attempts to organise and relate this to the present where architects are engaging in unethical practices due to lack of agency and precarious working conditions. 

This residency is the starting point for a larger project which will exhibit and raise awareness of these issues. The project is looking to collate materials and stories from the Architects Revolutionary Council, Matrix Feminist Design Co-operative, New Architecture Movement, Agency Research Centre, Architecture Lobby, Glasgow Letters on Architecture and Space and SAAL among other institutions and individuals.
