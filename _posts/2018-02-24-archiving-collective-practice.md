We are researching the history of attempts to collectively organise around Architectural Practice as a research residency at [May Day Rooms](http://maydayrooms.org/)in London, an active repository, resource and safe haven for social movements, experimental and marginal cultures and their histories. We aim to learn from past attempts to organise and relate this to our current condition where more than ever, architects are pushed to engage in unethical practice in poor working conditions with hardly any labour rights. This residency is the starting point for a larger project looking to exhibit and raise awareness of these issues. While based at the [Mayday Rooms Archive](http://maydayrooms.org/), we are exploring other archives and speaking to key figures and organisations who could help us with our studies. The project is looking to collate materials and stories from the Architects Revolutionary Council, Matrix Feminist Design Co-operative, New Architecture Movement, Agency Research Centre, Architecture Lobby,Glasgow Letters on Architecture and Space and SAAL among other institutions and individuals.
