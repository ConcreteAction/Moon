The concreteaction.net site is being rebooted to include new information and resources, in the meantime, you can see the projects which we are involved in on the projects tab on this site. We will be presenting at the [Fundamentals](http://events.arts.ac.uk/event/2018/3/2/FUNDAMENTALS-The-Way-We-Work-Symposium/ "Fundamentals Symposium") on Friday the 2nd of March. If you would like to attend but can't afford a ticket send us a message.
